# MaodeETN
MaodeETN (Maode Encrypted Text Notebook) is an encrypted notebook for the Windows platform where you can write text and store it encrypted with a password.

I created this project on August 16, 2024, and only now I remembered this project. Then I fixed some bugs and added some content, and finally published it on GitHub.

I may update some safer and more interesting features later.

I probably won't update this project anytime soon; it might only get updated if I remember and become interested in it.
# Goal

Add more cryptographic algorithms.

Add some interesting features.......
